# Merchant Payment Gateway
__Introduction to Btceth and our payment gateway API for businesses__


Btceth is a blockchain payment processor, established in 2018. Currently, we support Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. Our mission is to grow adoption of cryptocurrencies on a global scale by laying out a reliable payments infrastructure that caters for the needs of both merchants and their customers: accessible, convenient and customer oriented.

With our solution, each and every business owner can start accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment using our REST API. To all of our merchants, we offer a simple framework for payment settlement. Whichever currency the customer pays with, it is settled either in Bitcoin or in Euros. This way, we maintain things convenient for the merchant, but flexible for the shopper.

## Merchant API for Cryptocurrency Payments

The Btceth API is designed as an easy starting point for online businesses and merchants that wish to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Btceth handles the payment flow from checkout to settlement, allowing businesses to use this innovative payment method without deep technical know-how and risks related to exchange rate fluctuations. The API is, therefore, suitable for applications from basic projects, to enterprise-level integration.

Our gateway provides full automation for accepting Bitcoin, Ether and other coins, unique addresses for each order, real-time transparent exchange rates for customers, and a platform for merchants to track and manage their payment history and payouts. See our example.

Configuration of our API for processing payments on virtually any website is rather straightforward. Merchant API credentials can be created from your Btceth account, where you can also add your payout details based on your preferred option for receiving settlements. API integration can be tested on our Sandbox environment (create separate credentials here) or straight in live mode.
